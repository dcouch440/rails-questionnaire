## Description
_Rails with Active Record_
This project introduces Rails and Active Record. Rails is an **MVC framework** that allows us to quickly bootstrap our applications. Active Record is an **ORM** (object-relational mapping) library that uses naming conventions to configure much of the interactions between our objects and the database tables that back them.
  
The following concepts are covered in this project:
* Databases with Models and Active Record
* Routes and Controllers
* Rake, a tool for running tasks
* Queries with Active
* Associations
* Validations
* Scopes
* shoulda-matchers
* 'require' shortcuts
